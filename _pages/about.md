I hold a Master's in Physics from the University of Manchester and completed my Neuroscience PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Michael Orger](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/research/groups/orger) at the Champalimaud Foundation, developing computational models of motor control through an EU-funded [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions project](https://zenith-etn.com/). Prior to my PhD, I worked as a Data Scientist at the UK Department for Transport.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computational modelling, dynamical systems theory, and experimental neuroscience. My main research focussed on inferring neural control signals driving zebrafish locomotion, developing open-source tools like differentiable optimal control algorithms and recurrent neural network models to understand how the brain controls movement.
<!-- I have presented his research at prestigious conferences including ICLR, Cosyne, and specialized workshops at the Janelia Research Campus. -->

I strongly believe in diversity and equality and have served on several DEI committees and workshops. I've also been active with [Science on the Walls](https://scienceonthewalls.github.io/), a science empowerment initiative for underserved communities in Lisbon, Portugal.
