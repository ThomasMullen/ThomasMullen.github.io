I received the Master degree in Physics in 2019 from the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Manchester, under the tutoring of Professor Wendy Flavell. My research project was partnered with the Christies Hospital Which was supervised by Marcel van Herk. After, I worked for the department of Transport as a data scientist. In October 2020 I transitioned into neuroscience when I was awarded Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie scholarship. I joined Vision in Action lab at Champalimaud Center for the Unknown, Portugal, where I am understanding avoidance strategies in larval zebrafish under the supervision of Dr. Michael Orger. This research project is affiliated with the [Zenith European Training Network](https://zenith-etn.com/), funded by Horizon 2020.

My main research interests are in complex systems and control theory. Particularly, how we can approximate them to be in linear regimes. A way to gain interpretation is by linearly approximating the dynamics. Linear systems are based on superpositions of different modes; therefore, it is very easy to control and understand that give rise to complex dynamics. Methods such as time-embedding can capture rich dynamics, while eigen-analysis provides a way to gain insights into the system through analysis of the principal components. In my current PhD work, I have applied dynamical systems approaches to understand the movements of larval zebrafish and to infer control models, which can be compared with neural data. I am particularly interested in how persistent internal states give rise to variability in responses, and how we can use modeling approaches to infer the underlying latent variables. To this end, I have begun recording whole-brain calcium imaging data, using light-sheet microscopy, in a paradigm where head-fixed larval zebrafish transition between different locomotor states.

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
