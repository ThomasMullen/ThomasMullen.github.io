My summer project was to fit and a generalized linear model (GLM) to generated spiking data. I wanted to learn how to fit a GLM to data from scratch and understand how it can be used to simulate/predict spiking activity given some external input which would correspond to the sensory input. In this article I shall outline the theory of a GLM, then show the results of this method to simulated data.
