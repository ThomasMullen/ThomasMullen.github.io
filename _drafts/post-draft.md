The larval zebrafish has a wide repertoire of different behaviours. Most of there behaviour can be characterised by the tail osccilation to produce a swim. These swims are highly varied yet controlled in order to achieve the goal of the fish. It can be thought that these swims are also stereotyped, such that there is a structured sequence of motor neurons that generate the swim, this is known as the motor pattern generator. In order to generate a specific type of swim requires a higher level command neuron to activate this motor pattern generator. We can now frame this as a dynamical system probem where the general decay of the tail oscillaton (motor pattern generator) is defined by the autonomous dynamics of system. But there is also a sparse control signal which perturbs the tail dynamics in the system which would correspond to the motor command neuron.

Inspired from works of Brunton et al. (2017) I decided to use this frame in the context of neuroethology.
