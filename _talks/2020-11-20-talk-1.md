Contouring variation is one of the largest systematic uncertainties in modern radiotherapy. Many studies have evaluated inter-observer variation in small patient cohorts, yet its effect on clinical outcomes has never been analysed quantitatively. We propose a novel framework to analyse the effect of contouring variation on clinical outcome for a large cohort of patients.
