Presented a poster at Federation of European Neuroscience Society (FENS) on a novel behaviour assay that induces zebrafish larvae to undergo a cascade of behavioural states.
Using optovin, a UV light flash triggers a cycle through different graded levels of fear that are reflected in different behavioural outputs, including various locomotor patterns and suppressed movement. Preliminary neural recordings show temporal similarities to the behavioural sequence, with the goal of identifying neural populations that modulate fear-related internal states.
