An science outreach project created by group of PhD students at the Champalimaud working with children at Cova da Moura, Amadora.

Cova da Moura is home to a beautifully diverse community, with residents of Cape Verdean, Angolan, Mozambican, and Guinea-Bissau heritage, alongside families from central and northern Portugal. Yet despite its vibrancy and strong sense of community, the neighborhood has historically faced economic marginalization and underrepresentation in higher education and STEM careers.

What is unique to Science on the Walls (SOTW) is that rather than expecting communities to come to science, SOTW brings science to the community â€“ embedding activities within neighborhood associations and partnering with local artists, musicians, and cultural leaders.

Over the past years, Science on the Walls has:

* Engaged more than 300 children aged 6-15
* Mobilised over 60 scientist volunteers from Lisbon's research institutions
* Established partnerships with 3 neighborhood associations
* Organized more than 25 interactive events, from AI workshops to marine biology expeditions
* Created lasting community installations that continue to spark curiosity long after events end
