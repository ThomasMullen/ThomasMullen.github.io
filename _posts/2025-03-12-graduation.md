I'm thrilled to share that I successfully defended my PhD in Lisbon at the Champalimaud Foundation! 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to my outstanding jury members:

* Lea Duncker, Columbia University Zuckerman Institute
* Tosif Ahamed, Janelia Research Campus HHMI
* Alfonso Renart, Champalimaud Foundation
* James Fitzgerald, Northwestern University

The past four years have been an extraordinary journey of discovery, taking me around the world to discuss my research with passionate scientists who share the same enthusiasm for understanding the brain.

## Special Acknowledgments

* Michael Orger - My supervisor and mentor, thank you for your unwavering guidance, support, and patience. You gave me the freedom to pursue what truly excited me and supported every decision and opportunity along the way.
* Adrien - My mentor who was always there with research help and invaluable feedback on both work and career planning.
* Marine - One of my closest collaborators and dear friend. Your constant support and research feedback have been invaluable.

## Communities That Shaped Me

üåç Zenith ETN network - Starting my PhD during COVID in a completely new field, this network provided essential support for both personal and professional growth.

üß† Imbizo network - A pivotal experience that kept me engaged in neuroscience while helping me recognize the critical importance of diversity and representation in science.

‚öñÔ∏è Science on the Wall network - Proud to be part of a team fighting for diversity in science and addressing minority representation challenges.

## Research Highlights

My thesis explored how the brain orchestrates movement in larval zebrafish, using a control-theoretic approach to understand motor behaviors. We discovered that the full natural locomotor repertoire can be effectively generated through sparse control signals driving a latent Recurrent Neural Network, offering new insights into neural activity and movement.

## Final Thanks

To my family and friends - none of this would have been possible without your love and support throughout these years. This journey has been complex but incredibly rewarding, and I'm grateful for everyone who believed in me.
Here's to the next chapter! üöÄ
